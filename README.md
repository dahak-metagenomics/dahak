# Dahak

Dahak is a software suite that integrates state-of-the-art open source tools for metagenomic analyses. Tools in the dahak software suite will perform various steps in metagenomic analysis workflows including data pre-processing, metagenome assembly, taxonomic and functional classification, genome binning, and gene assignment. We aim to deliver the analytical framework as a robust and reliable containerized workflow system, which will be free from dependency, installation, and execution problems typically associated with other open-source bioinformatics solutions. This will maximize the transparency, data provenance (i.e., the process of tracing the origins of data and its movement through the workflow), and reproducibility.

## Getting Started

Analysis protocols can be found in the [workflows](https://github.com/dahak-metagenomics/dahak/tree/master/workflows) directory. It is assumed that analysis will begin with [read filtering](https://github.com/dahak-metagenomics/dahak/tree/master/workflows/read_filtering) and instructions for Docker installation are included there. 

## Prerequisites

It is assumed that all steps will be executed using an Ubuntu 16.04 image. 

## Data 
For purposes of benchmarking this project will use the following datasets: 

- [Shakya, M., C. Quince, J. H. Campbell, Z. K. Yang, C. W. Schadt and M. Podar (2013). "Comparative metagenomic and rRNA microbial diversity characterization using archaeal and bacterial synthetic communities." Environ Microbiol 15(6): 1882-1899.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3665634/)
  - NCBI SRA Accession: [SRX200676](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRX200676)

- 50% subsample of Shakya et al. 2013*
  SRR606249_subset50_1.fq.gz

- 25% subsample of Shakya et al. 2013*
  SRR606249_subset25_1.fq.gz

- 10% subsample of Shakya et al. 2013*

*Subsampled data sets can be retrieved from the Open Science Framework using the [osfclient](https://github.com/dib-lab/osf-cli). See example in [read_filtering](https://github.com/dahak-metagenomics/dahak/tree/master/workflows/read_filtering).
