# Dahak

Dahak is a software suite that integrates state-of-the-art open source tools for metagenomic analyses. Tools in the dahak software suite will perform various steps in metagenomic analysis workflows including data pre-processing, metagenome assembly, taxonomic and functional classification, genome binning, and gene assignment. We aim to deliver the analytical framework as a robust and reliable containerized workflow system, which will be free from dependency, installation, and execution problems typically associated with other open-source bioinformatics solutions. This will maximize the transparency, data provenance (i.e., the process of tracing the origins of data and its movement through the workflow), and reproducibility.

## Getting Started

Analysis protocols can be found in the [workflows](https://github.com/dahak-metagenomics/dahak/tree/master/workflows) directory. It is assumed that analysis will begin with [read filtering](https://github.com/dahak-metagenomics/dahak/tree/master/workflows/read_filtering) and instructions for Docker installation are included there. 

You can run these protocols interactively using Docker or automate them using Snakemake and Singularity. See the workflows [README](https://github.com/dahak-metagenomics/dahak/blob/master/workflows/README.md) for Docker, Snakemake and, Singularity istall instructions. 

The assembly, comparison, functional inference, and taxonomic classification workflows are depednent upon the output of the read filtering workflow data. You can download our data to use in the read filtering protocol from the openscience framework. See the section below titled Data and the read filtering protocol for more information. 

## Prerequisites

Currently, for the sake of simplicity, it is assumed that all workflow steps
will be run from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

dahak is not a standalone program, but rather a collection of workflows
that are defined in snakemake files and that utilize bioconda and Docker
to install and run software for different tasks.

See the [`workflows/`](/workflows/) directory to get started.

## Data 

For purposes of benchmarking this project will use the following datasets: 

| Dataset |Description |
|---|---|
| Shakya complete | Complete metagenomic dataset from Shakya et al., 2013<sup>*</sup> containing bacterial and archaeal genomes|
| Shakya subset 50 | 50 percent of the reads from Shakya complete|
| Shakya subset 25 | 25 percent of the reads from Shakya complete|
| Shakya subset 10 | 10 percent of the reads from Shakya complete|
