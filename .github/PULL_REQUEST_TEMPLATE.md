#### Merge Checklist

- [ ] Typos are a sign of poorly maintained code. Has this request been checked with a spell checker?
- [ ] Tutorials should be universally reproducible. If this request modifies a tutorial, does it assume we're starting from a blank Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial Xerus) image?
- [ ] Large diffs to binary or data files can artificially inflate the size of the repository. Are there large diffs to binary or data files, and are these changes necessary?
