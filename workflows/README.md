# Workflows

This directory contains the workflow files.

Each workflow has a corresponding folder here that contains a
Snakefile that defines all of the rules in that workflow.

Workflow parameters, workflow configuration, and data file specification
files live in the `config/` folder.

Slurm cluster configuration files and job submission scripts live 
in the `slurm/` folder.
