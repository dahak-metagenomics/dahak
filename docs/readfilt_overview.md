# Read Filtering Workflow

![Quality assessment](img/Workflow1_QA.png)

**The read filtering step consists of processing raw reads from a 
sequencer, such as discarding reads with a high uncertainty value
or trimming off adapters.**

Tools like Fastqc and Trimmomatic will perform this filtering 
process for the sequencer's reads.
